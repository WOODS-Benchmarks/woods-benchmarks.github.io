## CAP
  - **Motivation:** A recurrent problem in computational medicine is that models trained on data from a given recording device will not generalize to data coming from another device, even when both devices are from a similar equipment provider. Failure to generalize to unseen machines can cause critical issues for clinical practice because a false sense of confidence in a model could lead to a false diagnosis. We study these machinery-induced distribution shifts with the CAP dataset.
  - **Problem:** We consider the sleep stage classification task from electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements. The dataset has five source domains, where each domain contains data gathered with a different machine. The goal is to generalize to unseen machines.
  - **Downloads:** The preprocessed data is available on [Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/details/500d0c473108ef72e01b0f8037251b09331467f9) and via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NFwX2CqLrenWF4az0c6J-OglAoD48PAT). It can also be directly downloaded through the <a href="https://github.com/jc-audet/WOODS">WOODS repository</a>.
